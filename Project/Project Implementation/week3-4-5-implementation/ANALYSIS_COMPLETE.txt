File Size Limitations:
- Some files read with line limits due to file size
- FeeManagement.vue: read truncated at 100 lines
- TeacherManagement.vue: read truncated at 100 lines
- Reports.vue: read truncated at 100 lines
- Settings.vue: read partial (150 lines)
- SystemHealthMonitor.vue: read partial (100 lines)

Recommendations for Future Analysis:
- Conduct backend API verification
- Perform load testing with large datasets
- Security audit for data protection
- Accessibility audit (WCAG compliance)
- Performance profiling
- User testing of admin workflows

CONCLUSION:
===========

The SAMS admin portal demonstrates solid foundational architecture with
modern Vue 3 patterns and a consistent design language. The core CRUD
operations for users, courses, and attendance are working properly.

However, the implementation is approximately 65% complete with several
critical gaps in data validation, error handling, and missing features.
The most immediate concerns are:

1. Mock data in production code
2. Weak form validation
3. Missing bulk operations
4. Performance optimization needed
5. Incomplete feature implementations

With focused effort on the critical and high-priority items, the admin
portal can reach production-ready status within 2-3 weeks.
